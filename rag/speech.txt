Thank you for giving me the opportunity to speak on an issue that affects each and every one of us — climate change. We live in an era of unprecedented technological advancement, but also in a time of great environmental uncertainty. Our choices — as individuals, communities, businesses, and nations — are shaping the future of our planet. Today, I want to speak not just about the science of climate change, but the reality we face, the consequences we are already witnessing, and the urgent action that we must take.
Climate change refers to long-term shifts in temperatures and weather patterns, primarily caused by human activities — most notably the burning of fossil fuels like coal, oil, and gas. These activities release greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide and methane, into the atmosphere. These gases trap heat, creating a "greenhouse effect" that warms the Earth.

It’s important to understand that climate change is not just about rising temperatures. It’s about rising sea levels, melting glaciers, more intense hurricanes, devastating floods, prolonged droughts, and wildfires. It’s about biodiversity loss, collapsing ecosystems, and widespread human suffering.
The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), a body of thousands of the world’s top climate scientists, has been warning us for decades. Their reports show a clear trend: if global temperatures rise more than 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels, we will enter dangerous territory.

We are currently on track for a 2.5°C to 3°C rise by the end of the century if we continue business as usual. This means more frequent extreme weather events, water scarcity affecting billions, and the disappearance of entire ecosystems. Think about that: not just disruption, but destruction.
